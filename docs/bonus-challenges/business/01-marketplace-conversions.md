# 🛒 Product Challenge: Improve Marketplace Conversions

**Difficulty:** Hard ⭐⭐⭐

---

## The Problem

The marketplace has a complete booking flow: browse listings → view details → book placement. But **conversion rates are low**. Users browse but don't click through, or they view listings but don't book.

---

## Your Task

Analyze the marketplace experience and **propose + implement changes** that would increase bookings.

This challenge tests your:

- **Product thinking** - Can you identify friction points and solutions?
- **UX intuition** - Do you understand what drives user action?
- **Design skills** - Can you execute your ideas well?
- **Business sense** - Do you think about metrics and outcomes?
- **Technical skills** - Can you implement your ideas cleanly?

---

## Current State

The marketplace exists at `/marketplace` with detail pages at `/marketplace/[id]`.

**What you'll notice:**

- Cards show basic info but lack visual appeal
- No clear reason to click one listing over another
- Detail page has a booking form, but is it compelling?
- The journey from browsing to booking feels... flat
- Nothing creates urgency or excitement
- Users can book, but do they _want_ to?

Take a few minutes to click around. What feels off? What's missing?

---

## The Conversion Funnel

```
Marketplace Grid → Click Listing → View Details → Book Placement
```

Where are users dropping off? Why?

---

## Things to Consider

### Grid → Detail Page (Click-through)

- What makes a card compelling enough to click?
- Is critical information visible or hidden?
- Does the grid help users find relevant listings?
- Are there enough visual cues and hierarchy?

### Detail Page → Booking (Conversion)

- Does the page answer buyer questions?
- Is the value proposition clear?
- What objections might prevent booking?
- Is the CTA prominent and compelling?

### Overall Experience

- How does the flow feel end-to-end?
- Where is there unnecessary friction?
- What's missing that users would expect?
- How do you build trust and urgency?

---

## What to Submit

1. **Document your analysis** - What problems did you identify? What's your hypothesis?
2. **Implement improvements** - Build your solutions
3. **Explain measurement** - How would you track if it's working?

---

## What We're Looking For

✅ Clear identification of conversion barriers  
✅ Thoughtful solutions tied to user psychology  
✅ Quality implementation  
✅ End-to-end thinking (not just one page)  
✅ Consideration of how to measure success

❌ Not looking for: Pixel-perfect designs or complex architecture. Focus on impact.
